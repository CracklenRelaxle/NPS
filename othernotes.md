Different ideas
Maybe make a module?
Downsize data

Run PCAP through Zeek
Aggregate or correlate logs together
Singapore university dataset?
Electric power maybe
simulated - iec104
  -likely iec104 that we need to look at
backnet for AC
Sergio
gaining benign dataset with various items and then attack
Siam system and splunk?
Use zeek logs on static data
Maybe compare a PCAP with dominion energy

For getting iec104: idaho national labs
