## how to install snortML
There are a couple easy ways to accomplish this task. Option 1 is to install the Snort 2.9 executable or snort3 tarball from `https://www.snort.org/downloads#snort3-downloads` and then compile with CMAKE + C++ compiler. 

Option 2 is to download the container for snort 3 on docker hub `https://hub.docker.com/r/ciscotalos/snort3` 

Now that we have snort installed, SnortML is going to need libML from `https://github.com/snort3/libml`
